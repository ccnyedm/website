<p>Nationally recognized, award-winning book jacket designer Chin-Yee Lai gave a compelling presentation on November 29 at the final meeting of the EDM Club, for the Fall 2018 semester. During her talk, through photographs and personal anecdotes, she revealed her struggles arriving in New York at age 15, and how she used every connection and work situation, to optimize her path to success as a graphic designer. The advice she shared at the end was invaluable, highlighting the need to be kind (the industry is small), show strong effort (it will be recognized by superiors), and stay positive (it will support all aspects of one's life).

<h2 style="margin-top:-6px" class="red">Laisa Barros Wins a Prestigious Summer 2018 Internship at PIXAR!</h2>
<p><br>EDM student Laisa Barros (Computer Science major, Digital Design minor with a focus in UX/UI and Animation) was awarded a highly-competitive internship at Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, California over the summer of 2018. Bringing her knowledge in computer programming, language, and scripting to the table, Laisa worked as a Production Support Engineering Intern within Pixar’s Systems Department. Her day-to-day duties involved assisting Pixar animators with Wacom and Cintiq graphic tablets, troubleshooting Linux software operating systems and workstations for technical artists, and assisting Pixar engineers in reconfiguring a code-based computer application for studio printing. And, she enjoyed working closely with Pixar animators and technical artists on a daily basis. “I appreciate the sense of community and how passionate everyone is about their jobs…I really enjoyed the balance between work and fun. Whether it be tea time on Friday or sharing a random story out of the blue, those moments kept the team connected and allowed us to get to know each other.”
</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to her degree-relevant courses in digital design computer science, she cites campus-led WiTNY, hackathons, CUNYCodes, and CUNY Tech Prep as invaluable sources of training prior to her arrival at the Pixar campus. “(Over the summer) I learned so much about the infrastructure of the studio as a whole: from how to manage workstations using internal tools to even learning about license management. I also learned a new programming language, Ruby. I didn't know Ruby at all but my co-workers were patient and provided me with resources to get started. I was able to contribute in the refactoring of a printing utility that helped to improve the printing environment for everyone (at Pixar).”
</p><br>
<p>
The internship has pushed her further as a dual artist and engineer. “I feel more confident in my skills and ready to take on new challenges as I grow as an engineer. As an artist, I further understand the 3D animation pipeline so I am now incorporating a lot more research and direction into my art practice.”

<h2 class="red" style="margin-top: -5px">PIXAR Returns to EDM!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On <span class="bold">Monday, September 17, 2018</span>, four representatives from Pixar Animation Studios, based in
Emeryville, California, returned to speak with Electronic Design and Multimedia students within
the City College Art Department. Approximately 75 students were in standing-room-only
attendance for the 12pm-3:30pm event.</p>
<br>
<p>
Gini Santos (Supervising Animator, <span class="red">Coco</span>; animator on <span class="red">Up, Finding Nemo, Toy Story 2</span>),
MontaQue Ruffin (animator on <span class="red">Incredibles 2, Finding Dory</span>) and Christina Faraj (Pixar Technical
Director; animator on <span class="red">Coco, Incredibles 2</span>) were joined by Beth Sasseen (Pixar University
Relations) to speak with EDM students about career and internship possibilities within the
animation field—using their Oscar-winning feature film, <span class="red">Coco</span>, as a central framework for
discussion.
</p><br>
<p>
From 12pm to 2pm, the animators provided individualized lectures on animation principles—
ranging from character development to set construction—with each animator providing relatable
examples of their own student work to visually chart their career success. From 2pm to 3:30pm,
the conversation continued with a Q&A in Pilar Newton-Katz’s 2D Animation Principles course,
where the Pixar team spoke about internship possibilities at the Emeryville Campus and their
Pixar Undergraduate Program (PUP), in which undergraduates benefit from classroom-style
mentorships at Pixar.
