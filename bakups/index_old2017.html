<h2>Gregory Betty found his "dream job" as a designer at 10.Deep</h2>
<p class="imageright "><img class="right" src="images/gregbettysmall4.jpg" alt="Gregory Betty" border="0"/></a>
Greg Betty is now living his dream as a designer at 10.Deep [<a href="http://10deep.com" target="_blank">http://10deep.com</a>]. He started out as a Civil Engineering major, with a minor in art, then switched to the Digital Design Concentration in EDM. After a lot of hard work, and mentoring by Profs. Smith and Francis, he found his dream job after one year on the market. Gregory's advice to students: &ldquo;School is much more than getting good grades. It's about developing new skills and discipling yourself to carry these new found skills into the real world. Everything that I learned and worked on since my freshman year has helped me get to where I am now. It's very important to keep yourself busy with personal projects and artistic hobbies because the passion and drive you put into them will push you to go further and work harder, which only leads to good things.&rdquo;   <br /><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/gregory-betty-38b496b5" target="_blank">Connect with Gregory on LinkedIn</a></p>  <p class="clear"></p>

<h2>Natali Cabrera Jorge wins a prestigious Summer 2017 Art Direction Internship</h2>
<p class="imageleft "><img class="left" src="images/NataliCabreraJorge_small2.jpg" alt="NatalieCabrera" border="0"/></a>
This summer, EDM Bachelor of Arts student Natali Cabrera Jorge Natali will be a full-time intern with Partners + Napier in Rochester, New York, a creative agency with clients including BMW, Xerox, and USA Today. <br /><br />

Natali is a double major in Digital Design (EDM) and Advertising + Public Relations at CCNY. About her dual course of study, Natali states: “I’ve been pursuing the Advertising / Public Relations and Digital Design Bachelor of Arts degree at The City College of New York. It has been a wonderful experience that is letting me exponentially improve my skill set (in design and advertising). At the same time, it’s making me conscious of how ready I am to go out and impact society in a positive way.” She adds: “More than a graphic designer, I want to be an Art Director or a Creative Director. I want to use my curiosity and creativity to create unique ad campaigns. The graphic design experience (from EDM) will help me to communicate and work better with the professionals doing the illustration for the ideas I generated.” <br /><br />

<p class="bold">The MAIP internship program connects superior design students with leading advertising agencies in order to better prepare them for industry positions within advertising and design. Students obtain immersive on-the-field training, working for 22 weeks with agency professionals on various ac​counts and building client relationships (students gain 12 weeks of virtual online training and 10 weeks of agency experience). <br /><br />
