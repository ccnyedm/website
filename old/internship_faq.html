<h2>Internship FAQ: Internship Procedures for Students</h2>

<span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter ">
  You may find internship opportunities on the web, on the EDM Club Facebook
  page, or through the Career Center in the NAC building.
<br><br>
  Please understand that EDM cannot find internships for every student. Many
  students find internships through various websites. We will post some
  openings on the EDM Club Facebook page. Often we will try to match the
  best students to interview for internships which require specific skill sets.
<br><br>
  Internships are valuable whether or not you receive credit for them. Some
  internships require proof from the college that students will receive, or
  are eligible to receive, credit for the internship. If necessary, the
  Internship Advisor can provide a letter stating this.
<br><br>
</span>

<hr>

<h3 class="redbold">To
  get credit for your internship, here are the steps you need to take:</h4>

<ol>
<li class="halfspaceafter">Locate an internship opportunity, through a professor, Office of Career Services or on your own <span class="redbold"> BEFORE the semester starts.</span></li>
<li class="halfspaceafter"></span> Fill out the <span class="black1em">Application for Independent
    Study and Creative Projects forms</span> (you can get this in the Art Department
    Office, Room 109 or by email from the Art Advisor, Ms. Suerynn Lee at slee1(at)ccny.cuny.edu). The application requires a <span class="black1em">100-200 word Project Proposal</span>
    (a description of the duties and expectations of your specific internship).
  </li>
<li class="halfspaceafter"> Email both forms for signature to <span class="black1em"> Professor He</span> <span class="redbold">BEFORE or during registration.</span> <br>  Either the Internship
    Advisor or a different EDM Professor/mentor for your internship  must sign the forms.
  </li>
<li class="halfspaceafter"> Next, get the <span class="black1em">Art
    Department Chair's signature</span> on the Application by email by sending the signed forms to Ms. Lee. <br><br>
    Once you have all the signatures, email completed copies of the Application and Project Proposal to the Faculty
    Internship Advisor (Prof. He), the Art Department (Ms. Lee), and keep one copy for yourself).
  </li>

<li class="halfspaceafter"><span class="faculty-color"> Contact Ms. Henderson in the Art Office <span class="bold">khenderson(at)ccny.cuny.edu </span>for registration procedures.</li>

  <li class="halfspaceafter">To get a grade at the end of your
    internship, <span class="redbold">obtain a letter from your
    internship supervisor</span> evaluating your performance in detail. The
    letter goes to the Faculty Internship Advisor and <span class="black1em"> must be sent from
    your supervisor's work email account as a PDF on company letterhead or
    delivered as a hardcopy in sealed in an envelope and signed by the
    supervisor along the flap</span>.
<li class="halfspaceafter">Letters must be received by the last day of classes, according to the College calendar.</li>
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="black1em halfspaceafter">The Faculty Internship  Advisor [or the faculty member who signed on your
   internship] will enter a grade based on your internship supervisor's evaluation.
</p>

<p class="bold spaceafter">*** Internships will not be processed once general class registration ends.</p>

<span class="bolded spaceafter">The Internship Faculty Advisor</span> is <span class="redbold"><a href="faculty.html">Professor Sherry Muyuan He</a></span>.

<h3 class="p-2">How to be a Successful Intern</h3>
<p  class="p-2 black1em">Follow these simple guidelines to make a good impression.</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet;<span class="bold"> Be reliable.</span>  <br>
      This is the single most important rule! Be on time or early. Don't make any excuses; just BE
      there. Once you have agreed on a schedule, stick to it, no matter what.<br><br>
  </span>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet;<span class="bold"> Be positive.</span> <br>
      Be friendly and upbeat. Show that you are happy for this opportunity. Have a good attitude.
      Internships are competitive; remember that it is a privilege to be where you are. Having this
      internship on your resume will be valuable when you begin your job search later on.<br><br>
  </span>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet;<span class="bold">Be observant.</span><br>
      On your first day, check out what everyone is wearing. and how they are behaving. Try to be
      aware of what is considered acceptable attire and try to emulate it. Itâ€šs different from
      dressing for school; when in a professional environment, you must dress accordingly.
  </span><br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Pay attention to the interaction between department members.</span><br>
      If you watch carefully, you will pick up signals that will tell you how to conduct yourself
      professionally, and you will begin to learn how the creative process works. Ask politely if
      you may be included in meetings. Remember that you are there only to observe, and you should
      assume that the proceedings of the meeting are confidential.
  <br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Be respectful.</span> <br>
      Important business is going on. Understand that people are busy and are juggling many tasks.
      Although every creative environment is different, don't be fooled by appearances. While the
      atmosphere may seem casual, staffers are responsible for meeting goals and deadlines; the work
      is very serious even if people seem to be joking around.
<br><br>
<span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Be proactive.</span> <br>
      Don't wait for someone to tell you what to do. Ask your supervisor if he/she needs anything
      at all. If not, ask everyone else in the art department. You are not only there to learn,
      but to help with whatever tasks you are asigned.
<br><br>
</div>
  <div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Be realistic.</span> <br>
      Don't expect to do design work right away. You may be asked to do mundane tasks such as
      copying, faxing, filing or returning artwork until you have shown that you can handle more
      responsibility and that you can be trusted to follow through with your work.
  <br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Be diligent.</span> <br>
      Complete all assignments on time. Work turned in late, no matter how good, may be of
      no value. Try to go above and beyond what you are asked to do. Take full responsibilty
      for your work. If your supervisor has to work late, ask whether you are needed before going home.
  <br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Be helpful.</span> <br>
      Offer to go out for snacks or soda; this shows that you are willing to help make
      staffers' jobs easier with even the smallest of tasks. Remember that simply by being
      in a professional creative environment and observing how team members interact, you
      are gaining valuable experience in learning how to conduct yourself in the 'real' world.
  <br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Communicate.</span> <br>
    Don't be shy. Don't wait for your supervisor to ask how you are doing with a task; keep your
    supervisor informed frequently. Don't be afraid to ask questions; you are there to learn and
    most members of the department are happy to answer your questions.
<br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter">&bullet; <span class="bold"> Remember, you have a lot at stake.</span> <br>
      If you make a good impression, there is a possibility that you may be offered freelance
      (paying ) work and possibly even a staff position (this happens more often than you think!).
  <br><br>
  <span class="halfspacebefore spaceafter bold">
      Even if your internship ends and there are no immediate opportunities, if you make
      a good impression you may be called back when a spot opens up; you will have an inside
      track because you are a 'known quantity'. And even if that doesn't happen, or if you
      want to try a different area of graphic design, if you leave a good impression you
      can ask your supervisor whether you may use him/her as a reference when you are job-hunting.
  <br><br>
