      EDM student Laisa Barros (Computer Science major, Digital Design minor with a focus in UX/UI and Animation)who was the first (2018) CCNY summer intern at Pixar, has been hired by Pixar as a Production Support Engineer, the same area as her Internship. </span><br><br>

    <span>  Says Laisa, &ldquo;My job requires me to be able to communicate with both technical and non-technical people. I am assisting them daily with desktop equipment for their virtual workstations whether it be a faulty hardware or software. I'm also writing scripts for command line utilities or using command line interface tools to diagnose virtual machines issues. I truly enjoy helping people and it's very rewarding to see how happy they get once I fix their workstations. I love Pixar's culture of learning and the constant collaboration and open communication that I have with my team. I feel like everyday I am learning something new and that I am encouraged to do so. I'm really happy I found a way to combine art and technology in my career. I'm super happy to be doing my dream job!&rdquo;</span><br><br>

During her talk, through photographs and personal anecdotes, she revealed her struggles arriving in New York at age 15, and how she used every connection and work situation, to optimize her path to success as a graphic designer. The advice she shared at the end was invaluable, highlighting the need to be kind (the industry is small), show  effort (it will be recognized by superiors), and stay positive (it will support all aspects of one's life).
