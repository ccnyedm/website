            Fridays, 2pm to 4:50pm, 3.0 credit hours<br>

            Special Topics class is in partnership with the CCNY Dominican Studies Institute</span>
        </b><br><br>
        In this experimental illustration and motion-design class, students will design an animated and web-based
        narrative to retell the story of the first documented anti-slavery rebellion which took place in 1521 at a
        Dominican Republic sugar plantation. Working from a provided script, students will generate illustrated
        responses
        and storyboards before generating a collaborative website incorporating animation, illustration, information
        design, and sound to convey the historical, emotional, and social impacts of this uprising. Throughout the
        semester, students will have access to experts from the CCNY Dominican Studies Institute and will collaborate
        with
        Sonic Arts students in sound design, dialogue editing, and audio mixing. The collaborative project, in
        remembrance
        of the rebellion’s 500th anniversary, will bring this forgotten event to a wider audience and public
        consciousness. For example, students’ visual work will be featured on the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute’s
        website, First Blacks in the Americas / Los Primeros Negros en Las Américas, an internationally recognized and
        one-of-a-kind digital site, also the product of a collaboration among experts, students, and others. This
        Special
        Topics class is in partnership with the CCNY Dominican Studies Institute.<br><br>

        In Spring 2021, thanks to a generous donation from the Robinson Center for Graphic Arts and Communication
        Design,
        EDM is running an Animation Master Class for students aspiring to launch their careers within the animation
        industry. Students pitch an idea to be selected for the class, and are accepted based on prior experience,
        animation career goals, and their project idea. This semester, students are intensively working on conceptual,
        technical, and industry skills to develop professional-level portfolios in animation. The class is being taught
        by
        Professor Pilar Newton.<br /> <br />

          <div class="spacebefore">
            During Fall 2020, students in Nathan Sensel's Illustration 2 course met for a 2-hour conversation with
            designer and illustrator Charly Palmer, who runs a successful design studio in Atlanta, Georgia. Charly,
            whose artwork was recently featured on the cover of Time Magazine, has a fortune 500 clientele and is the
            artist of children's books including Mama Africa! about Miriam Makeba. The wide-ranging discussion included
            a tour of his studio and a look at current work and collaborations. Many of the questions that the students
            asked led to insights and reflections on getting started in the industry and the ins and outs of
            collaboration.

      <h3>The City College Archive Reading Room [NAC Room 5/301] will host the exhibition, Fables of Aesop: A
        Typographic Exploration from January 30—March 5, 2020. </h3>

      Work exhibited explores visual interpretations of the fables, as well as employing design as a tool and weapon to
      communicate ethical purpose. The books in this exhibition were created in Professor Anne Bartoc Fink’s Typography
      2 class in
      Spring, 2019.<br /><br />

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <span class="spacebefore">
            Last Spring, Professor Anne Bartoc Fink assigned her Typography II students the objective of creating a
            modern interpretation of Aesop’s Fables. The text would remain as written, but the design of the text could
            be altered. All
            illustrations would be created from letterforms alone.<br /><br />

            Why this assignment? …as a way to disseminate and develop personal conviction&emdash;to use design as a tool
            and weapon to communicate ethical purpose. Each story revealed a lesson in the human condition, guiding
            readers with wit and
            caution.<br /><br />

            We are living in paradoxical times, constantly questioning our belief systems in response to the barrage of
            information fed to us daily from a myriad of sources. Aesop’s Fables seemed to be the perfect vehicle to
            address our moral core
            and potential as effective communicators. Aesop (620—564BC) lived as a slave in Ancient Greece. His tales,
            told in the oral tradition, have survived over 2500 years of reinterpretation and adaptation.<br /><br />

            In the Aesop’s fables assignment, the Typography II students wrestled with the content of each story,
            redesigning it to enlighten us with the wisdom of these moral tales. Each student was given a single letter
            which was to be created in
            two materials, one being paper. When all the books were assembled, they would spell out the title, "Fables
            of Aesop." Students saw how their individual artistic vision became a valuable part of a whole, greater than
            the individual
            parts;
            in itself a valuable ethical lesson.

              EDM student Laisa Barros (Computer Science major, Digital Design minor with a focus in UX/UI and
              Animation)who was the first (2018) CCNY summer intern at Pixar, has been hired by Pixar as a Production
              Support Engineer, the same area as
              her Internship. <br><br>

              <p>Says Laisa, &ldquo;My job requires me to be able to communicate with both technical and non-technical
                people. I am assisting them daily with desktop equipment for their virtual workstations whether it be a
                faulty hardware or
                software.
                I'm also writing scripts for command line utilities or using command line interface tools to diagnose
                virtual machines issues. I truly enjoy helping people and it's very rewarding to see how happy they get
                once I fix their
                workstations.
                I love Pixar's culture of learning and the constant collaboration and open communication that I have
                with
                my team. I feel like everyday I am learning something new and that I am encouraged to do so. I'm really
                happy I found a way to
                combine art and technology in my career. I'm super happy to be doing my dream job!&rdquo;

              Pixar's Beth Sasseen, Head of University Outreach, and Sets Art Director Paul Abadilla spoke to an
              overflow
              crowd of students gathered in CG252 on October 31st. This was Pixar's third visit to
              EDM.</span><br /><br />

            Paul Abadella gave students an overview of his career in animation. He showed some whimsical sketches
            depicting his childhood in the Philippines as well as some of his set design work on <span
              classs="font-italic">Brave, Coco and Monsters
              U</span>. He then gave a description of his work on the <span classs="font-italic">Incredibles II</span>
            abd
            showed storyboard animatics for a climactic scene in which Elastigirl discovers the Lair. <br /><br />

            Abadilla started as a sketch artist in several Pixar art departments doing shading and set design on the
            feature films <span classs="font-italic">Monsters University</span> and the Academy Award®-winning films
            <span classs="font-italic">Brave Inside Out, Coco</span> and <span classs="font-italic">The
              Incredibles 2</span>. In addition, Abadilla has worked on the short films <span classs="font-italic">The
              Blue Umbrella</span>, Pixar’s first television special <span classs="font-italic">Toy Story of
              TERROR!</span>, <span classs="font-italic">LAVA</span> and the Academy Award®-nominated <span
              classs="font-italic">Sanjay’s Super Team</span>.​<br /><br /> He recently wrapped production on the
            upcoming
            film <span classs="font-italic">Soul</span> which is an
            upcoming fantasy adventure comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.
            <br /><br />

            Beth Sasseen then took students through the steps of applying for the Pixar summer internship. She showed a
            presentation describing each type of Pixar internship, gave tips about what Pixar looks for in student
            portfolios and explained
            the
            application process. After the presentation, students moved over to Professor Newton's class for portfolio
            reviews and to continue the conversation!<br /><br />
